You can also set the fluid property to one of the Bootstrap breakpoints:
"sm", "md", "lg", "xl" or "xxl", so that the container fluidly expands to
fill the screen until the specified breakpoint, then resize responsively
at higher breakpoints.}

\item{tag}{Character. HTML tag to apply the container class to, default: div}

\item{loading_state}{Lists containing elements 'is_loading', 'prop_name', 'component_name'.

  - prop_name (character; optional): holds which property is loading
  - component_name (character; optional): holds the name of the component that is loading. Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer}
