## Sharing Data Between Callbacks

In order for to share data safely across multiple python
processes, we need to store the data somewhere that is accessible to
each of the processes. There are 3 places to store this data:

1 - In the user's browser session

2 - On the disk (e.g. on a file or on a new database)

3 - In a shared memory space like with Redis

The following three examples illustrate these approaches.

## Example 1 - Storing Data in Hidden Div

To save data in user's browser's session:
- Implemented by saving the data as part of Dash's front-end store
through methods explained in
[https://community.plot.ly/t/sharing-a-dataframe-between-plots/6173](https://community.plot.ly/t/sharing-a-dataframe-between-plots/6173)
- Data has to be converted to a string like JSON for storage and transport
- Data that is cached in this way will _only be available in the
user's current session_.
- If you open up a new browser, the app's callbacks will always
compute the data. The data is only cached and transported between
callbacks within the session.
- As such, unlike with caching, this method doesn't increase the
memory footprint of the app.
- There could be a cost in network transport. If your sharing 10MB
of data between callbacks, then that data will be transported over
the network between each callback.
- If the network cost is too high, then compute the aggregations
upfront and transport those.
Your app likely won't be displaying 10MB of data,
it will just be displaying a subset or an aggregation of it.

    "
This example outlines how you can perform an expensive data processing
step in one callback, serialize the output at JSON, and provide it
as an input to the other callbacks. This example uses standard dash
callbacks and stores the JSON-ified data inside a hidden div in
the app.

## Example 2 - Computing Aggregations Upfront

Sending the computed data over the network can be expensive if
the data is large. In some cases, serializing this data and JSON
can also be expensive.

In many cases, your app will only display a subset or an aggregation
of the computed or filtered data. In these cases, you could precompute
your aggreations in your data processing callback and transport these
aggregations to the remaining callbacks."
