# Change Log for Dash for R
All notable changes to `dash` will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.9.0] - 2020-10-31

### Fixed
- Fixes a minor bug in `setCallbackContext` (described in [#236](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/issues/236)) which prevented pattern-matching callbacks from working properly if one or more `input` statements did not include a selector. [#237](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/237)

### Changed

- Dash for R now depends on v1.1.1 of `dashHtmlComponents`
- Dash for R now depends on v1.13.0 of `dashCoreComponents`
- Dash for R now depends on v4.11.0 of `dashTable`
- `dash-renderer` version is now v1.8.3

## [0.8.0] - 2020-10-27
### Fixed
- Usage of `glue` has been corrected to address [#232](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/issues/232) via [#233](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/233).

### Added
- Pattern-matching IDs and callbacks. Component IDs can be lists, and callbacks can reference patterns of components, using three different wildcards: `ALL`, `MATCH`, and `ALLSMALLER`. This lets you create components on demand, and have callbacks respond to any and all of them. To help with this, `app$callback_context` gets three new entries: `outputs_list`, `inputs_list`, and `states_list`, which contain all the ids, properties, and except for the outputs, the property values from all matched components. [#228](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/228)
- New and improved callback graph in the debug menu. Now based on Cytoscape for much more interactivity, plus callback profiling including number of calls, fine-grained time information, bytes sent and received, and more. You can even add custom timing information on the server with `callback_context.record_timing(name, duration, description)` [#224](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/224)
- Support for setting attributes on `external_scripts` and `external_stylesheets`, and validation for the parameters passed (attributes are verified, and elements that are lists themselves must be named). [#226](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/226)
- Dash for R now supports user-defined routes and redirects via the `app$server_route` and `app$redirect` methods. [#225](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/225)

### Changed
- `dash-renderer` updated to v1.8.2

## [0.7.1] - 2020-07-30
### Fixed
- Fixes a minor bug in debug mode that prevented display of user-defined error messages when induced by invoking the `stop` function. [#220](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/220).
- URLs for unpkg.com for dash-renderer were outdated, and now fetch v1.6.0 also; `dash-renderer` v1.5.1 has been removed from `inst/lib`.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-07-28
### Added
- Dash for R now supports an `update_title` parameter, as in Dash for Python. [#218](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/218)

### Changed
- `dash-renderer` updated to v1.6.0
- Dash for R now depends on v4.9.0 of `dashTable` (provides several fixes from [#806](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/806), [#808](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/808) and [#809](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/809)) and v1.10.2 of `dashCoreComponents` (which updates Plotly.js to 1.54.7 via [#835](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/835)).

### Removed
- Dash for R no longer produces a warning when callbacks with no IDs are declared; see [#216](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/216).

## [0.6.3] - 2020-06-25
### Changed
- `dash-renderer` updated to v1.5.1

### Fixed
- Resolves a regression that prevented multiple loading states from displaying concurrently when a callback updates multiple outputs (for more details, see [#1310](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/1310)).

## [0.6.2] - 2020-06-19
### Fixed
- Dash for R now depends on v4.8.1 of `dashTable`, which fixes a bug where headers are unaligned with columns following an update (for more details, see [#797](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/797)).

## [0.6.1] - 2020-06-17
### Fixed
- Dash for R now depends on v1.10.1 of `dashCoreComponents`, which provides v1.54 of Plotly.js (for more details, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).

## [0.6.0] - 2020-06-17
### Changed
- Dash for R now depends on v4.8.0 of `dashTable`, which incorporates changes and bug fixes summarized in <https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/787>, <https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/785>, and <https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/793>.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-05-28
### Added
- Dash for R now depends on the `brotli` package explicitly; previously it was loaded when importing `reqres`. [#204](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/204)

### Changed
- Dash for R no longer wraps the layout in an `htmlDiv` internally, for parity with Dash for Python. Starting in v0.5.0, the `layout` method only accepts a single argument, and that argument must be a Dash component or a function that returns a Dash component. [#121](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/121)
- Package documentation has been significantly refactored to use new features of `roxygen2` when documenting R6 classes
- The `title` method now specifies `Dash` as the default application title instead of `dash`. [#200](https://github.com/plotly/dashR/pull/200)

### Fixed
- A minor bug in `validate_keys` which prevented `interpolate_index` from working as intended has been resolved

## [0.4.1] - 2020-05-08
